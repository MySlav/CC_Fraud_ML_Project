# CC_Fraud_ML_Project
Final student project of course "Machine Learning Methods".

The goal of this project was to apply knowledge learnt in course in a fully fledged project.

I decided to go with a binary classifcation problem, but with a twist, classes of output variable are highly imbalanced.


Dataset used: **[Credit Card Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)**
